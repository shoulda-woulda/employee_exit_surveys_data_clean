### Employee Exit Surveys: Data Cleaning and Analysis

**Overview:** This project involves data cleaning and analysis of employee exit surveys from two educational institutions in Australia: DETE (Department of Education, Training, and Employment) and TAFE (Technical and Further Education). The primary focus is on understanding the reasons for employee exits and how these reasons vary based on the length of service and age.

**Purpose:** 

**Data Cleaning:** Preprocess and clean data from the DETE and TAFE datasets to ensure consistency and accuracy. Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.

**Reasons for Employee Exits and the Impact of Length of Service and Age**: Analyze the main reasons employees are leaving each institution. Identify common themes or patterns in exit survey responses.
